                    <p class="r-frame">I'm a jack-of-all trades when it comes to technology. I've been working in the IT industry for 
                    about a decade and a half, as of writing. I've become a Network Engineer at the University of New Mexico in the time I pursued a 
                    Bachelors of Information and Communication Technology at New Mexico State University. I have pursued the Masters of IT program at NMSU similarly,
                    and both have offered new knowledge into different areas of IT. </p>

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p class="r-frame">My job history has included computer lab supervisor where I managed interns in the computer lab, as well as making minor apppearances in the information security field as well as the IT help desk.
                    These degrees have enforced my skillsets in my career now, network engineering. I've been in this specific industry for about 8 years.
